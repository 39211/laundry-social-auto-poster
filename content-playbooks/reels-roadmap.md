# Reels roadmap, day 18 to day 90

Programme runs 2026-07-11 to 2026-10-08. Day 18 is 2026-07-28, day 30 is
2026-08-09, day 60 is 2026-09-08.

## Why the targets changed

The plan escalated to 35 new followers a day and about 1,090 across the
programme. The measured rate at day 18 is 0.18 a day: 5 followers in 28 days.
A target sixty times reality does not stretch anyone. It makes every reading on
the dashboard meaningless, and it pushes toward posting volume and engagement
bait, which is what suppressed reach here in the first place.

Targets now assume Reels lift the rate to somewhere between 1 and 3 a day, which
for a single-city service account is already a good outcome.

## Measured baseline, 28 days to 2026-07-28

| | |
|---|---|
| Accounts reached | 743, of which 478 were not followers |
| Followers reached | 270 of 1,422, so 19% in a month |
| Accounts engaged | 13 |
| Profile link taps | 0 |
| Followers gained | 5 |
| Followers in Taichung | 77% |

The audience is right and distribution to strangers is working. Almost nobody
responds. That is the problem to solve, not the follower count.

## Follower targets

| Checkpoint | Date | Cumulative from day 18 | Total followers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 30 | 2026-08-09 | +8 to +15 | 1,430 to 1,437 |
| Day 60 | 2026-09-08 | +40 to +80 | 1,462 to 1,502 |
| Day 90 | 2026-10-08 | +100 to +250 | 1,522 to 1,672 |

Anything above +300 would be exceptional and should not be planned for.

## Business targets, which matter more

| Checkpoint | Inquiries | Bookings |
|---|---|---|
| Day 30 | 3 | 1 |
| Day 60 | 10 | 4 |
| Day 90 | 25 | 10 |

## Phases

**Day 18 to 30, testing.** One Reel a day in slot 2, alongside the daily slot 1
post. The owner chose daily over the two or three a week this plan originally
assumed, and production runs a full batch ahead so the cadence does not depend
on a good day. Topics are restricted to what the video model handles and what
carries intent: one item, its real failure point, and the before and after of
treating it. Testing whether a generated Reel with ambient audio and subtitles
can reach 300 accounts at a 30% watch ratio, whether it produces even one or two
real inquiries, and whether object-only shots feel too cold to women aged 25 to
44.

Daily is the one thing here that could backfire on its own. Repetition
downranking is real, and twelve consecutive Reels built from the same two-clip
structure is exactly the shape it punishes. The guards are that no two
consecutive days share an object type, and that the batch review at 72 hours
compares reach across the run: three consecutive Reels below a 20% watch ratio
drops the cadence rather than defending it.

**Day 31 to 60, scaling.** Three to four Reels a week plus one daily post. Keep
whatever before-and-after formats worked, add Taichung-specific problems (damp
season mould, children's stains, the commuter with no time) and start mixing in
short real phone footage, even two or three seconds of a hand or the shopfront.
Testing which topics produce inquiries rather than just reach, whether real
footage lifts watch ratio, and whether four a week trips repetition downranking.

**Day 61 to 90, converting.** Three to five Reels a week, only on topics already
proven to produce inquiries. Strengthen the call to action and reduce pure
display. Testing whether content produces traceable bookings and whether a small
paid boost on a proven Reel is worth it.

## Checkpoint rules

**Day 30, over the previous 12 days:**

- Inquiries ≥ 2 and engaged accounts ≥ 8 and mean Reel watch ratio ≥ 28%
  → continue and scale to three or four a week
- Otherwise inquiries ≥ 1 or engaged accounts ≥ 5
  → keep what worked, force real footage into every Reel, retest for two weeks
- Otherwise → stop generated-only Reels, return to posts and inquiry routing

**Day 60, over the previous 30 days:**

- Inquiries ≥ 8 and bookings ≥ 3 and followers gained ≥ 30
  → continue, strengthen calls to action, consider a small boost
- Otherwise inquiries ≥ 4 or bookings ≥ 1
  → narrow to the topics that produced inquiries
- Otherwise → stop pursuing growth through Reels; move to low frequency and
  high intent, and reconsider how much Instagram deserves

**At any point:** three consecutive Reels with a 7-day watch ratio below 20%, or
fewer than 3 engaged accounts, pauses that content type and raises a notice.

## Per-Reel thresholds

| | 72 hours | 7 days |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts reached | ≥ 300 | ≥ 800 |
| Non-follower share | ≥ 60% | ≥ 55% |
| Watch ratio | ≥ 35% | ≥ 30% |
| Accounts engaged | ≥ 5 | ≥ 12 |
| Saves plus shares | ≥ 3 | ≥ 8 |
| Profile visits or inquiries | ≥ 2 | ≥ 5 |

`src/reelBatchReview.ts` machine-checks accounts reached, accounts engaged, and
saves plus shares per Reel at 72 hours. Non-follower share is not checked per Reel:
Instagram's media insights endpoint has no follow-type breakdown for individual
posts, only account-level aggregate reach does (`breakdown=follow_type`, used in
`src/localReach.ts` for the programme-wide day-30/60 checkpoints, not attributable
to a single Reel). Watch ratio and profile visits/inquiries also are not currently
machine-checked per Reel.

## Production constraints

The video model deforms fingers during detailed hand work and cannot hold a
stain changing to clean inside one shot. Prompts therefore ask for one object,
one slow push-in, one continuous take of eight to ten seconds, with a forearm or
a tool entering from the edge of frame to suggest a person without drawing one.

Splicing two generated clips is the most likely thing to fail: two generations
will not match on colour temperature or shadow direction, and a hard cut between
them reads as two unrelated images. If that structure is ever built it needs
histogram matching and a half-second dissolve, both clips generated from the
same base still. Test two by hand before automating any of it.

Subtitles are not optional. More than 40% watch muted, so the hook in the first
two seconds and the closing call to action have to carry the message on their
own. Starting stills should be real photographs of the shop wherever possible.

Cap output at three to four Reels a week on distinct topics. A run of near
identical generated clips is what triggers repetition downranking.
